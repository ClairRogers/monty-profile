        <p>Monty is what the kids call Chaotic Stupid. He's small, wildly energetic, younger than most, and therefore
          everyone's self-assigned Annoying Little Brother. He may not be the smartest or the strongest, but he's quick
          and tireless, and genuinely kind at heart.</p>

            <p>18cm || 6lbs</p>
            <h3 class="marker">Body Type</h3>
            <p>Monty is rather small, even for his age, and quite lanky. Being the runt of his litter, he will probably
              never be quite
              as big as the other cats. He’s also still growing into his body, so he has long limbs and paws that are
              too big for him
              at his size. His tail is very expressive and almost always up, with a jaunty kink at the tip. His left
              canine is a
              snaggletooth.</p>
            <h3 class="marker">Fur Texture</h3>
            <p>Monty’s fur is mostly of the medium- to short-length variety. It would be soft and fluffy (almost like
              kit fur) if he
              cleaned it… but he doesn’t. He almost completely ignores common grooming standards, and his fur tends to
              be dirty and
              stick up in random directions.</p>
            <h3 class="marker">Color</h3>
            <p>Monty is basically a red marbled tabby. Most of his fur is reddish orange with dark swooping stripes, and
              a more
              tan/cream undercoat. His toes and tail tip are white, as well as a spot on his forehead and a little
              v-shape on his
              chest that sometimes looks like a heart. His eyes are blue.</p>
            <h3 class="marker">General Health</h3>
            <ul class="mb-5">
              <li>Excellent Health</li>

        <h1 class="marker biggie my-3">Personality</h1>
        <p>Monty is quite the annoying little guy, in truth. Frankly, he is probably no one’s favorite cat, but
          everyone
          somehow just tolerates his existence anyway. He is ADHD with an emphasis on the “hyperactive” part. He is
          constantly
          in motion
          and constantly has a high amount of energy and if you’re in his presence he probably won’t leave you alone. He
          likes to
          brag a lot but never has anything awesome to brag about, so really he just tells a bunch of boring and/or
          stupid stories
          that no one else is impressed by. But he doesn’t mind if no one really cares, as long as they listen with
          some
          fraction of attention.</p>
        <p>He’s a severe kleptomaniac and will steal things from you. He’s not specific. He’ll steal your food, your
          sleeping spot,
          your accessoreis, shiny rocks… anything he finds interesting at the time.
          He’s
          absolutely unapologetic about it too, but if you ask, he’ll happily give it back. Basically if you find
          yourself missing
          something, Monty probably stole it.</p>
        <p>There are a great many things Monty loves, including shiny objects, chasing leaves, hanging out with the Cool
          Older Kids,
          and pranking others. Rush is quite the trickster--as well as just stealing everyone’s stuff
          all the time, he also just loves to trick others and outsmart them for a laugh. He’s pretty shameless about it
          but also
          very childish, oftentimes failing to realize when he's gone too far. It’s not one of his better traits.</p>
        <p>Monty is a veritable wellspring of obscure and mostly
          useless
          information, especially when it comes to the Legendaries. He's a huge fanboy. He wouldn’t be able to tell you
          how to catch a mouse,
          but he would
          be able to tell you the name, family, and life story of almost any Legendary cat. He is intelligent, but he
          just
          doesn’t
          have time for the nonsense all the older cats want to teach him about hunting and surviving and being a
          productive member of
          society (blah blah blah).
          He cares about other cats, and will thus absorb and store any information about them he thinks is interesting.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the fact that oftentimes others find him annoying, he likes being around a lot of other cats.
          Especially the older boys--he's a huge groupie, and looks up to almost anyone older than him. He thinks
          they're SO cool and wants to be just like them, which is why he's determined to prove himself in these trials.
          He
          often doesn’t do well
          alone, and prefers the company of others. He lives a carefree and happy life, and he lives in the moment and
          takes things as they come and
          doesn’t let
          stuff drag him down. He's a great guy to be around if you need cheered up, because he will certainly make
          every effort to do so, even if he doesn't know or understand what you're sad about. He means well, and has a
          good heart. If you get to know him in this way, he is loveable, even if he’s too much to handle for
          extended
          periods of time.</p>

        <h3 class="marker">Short Version</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Monty was born in Plains Colony to his mother, Wynona, and an unknown father.</li>
          <li>He was one of a litter of five--while all of his siblings were strong and healthy, he was the runt of the
            litter…
            noticeably smaller and weaker.</li>
          <li>Wynona, thinking his chances of survival were slim, essentially abandoned him to focus her attending on
            keeping her
            other four kits alive.</li>
          <li>He was taken in by Quinn, a childhood friend of Wynona who couldn’t stand by and watch the little guy die.
            He even gave
            him his name, since Wynona hadn’t wanted to name him for fear of him dying.</li>
          <li>Still very young, Monty was taken with Quinn when he and his mate, Desmond, deserted the Plains Corps (and
            Plains Colony
            itself) after a bad run-in that left Desmond injured.</li>
          <li>The trio escaped Plains Colony and headed for Forest Colony, Quinn taking care both of young Monty and
            injured Desmond.</li>
          <li>After a couple weeks on their own, they eventually came to Forest Colony. There, they were welcomed in by
            the locals and
            taken care of.</li>
          <li>They spend several months at Forest Colony while Monty grew up and Desmond recovered from his injuries.
            Monty began
            showing his penchant for being extremely mischievous and getting into all kinds of trouble. Quinn especially
            is always
            very patient and understanding with him.</li>
          <li>When hearing of the call to Paradise Valley, Monty was wildly excited and begged his dads to let him go.
          </li>
          <li>Quinn doesn’t want to split up, but Desmond insists. Monty is RARING to go anyway. Desmond basically tells
            Quinn to go
            drop him off, and then come back to find me.</li>
          <li>Quinn and Monty set off for Paradise Valley. It was going to take them a week, if not longer, to get
            there, but Monty is
            quite determined.</li>
          <li>Several days in Quinn wakes up one morning with a fierce migraine. He thinks nothing of it, but it
            persists all day,
            getting worse and worse.</li>
          <li>The second day, Quinn does something he has never done before: he loses his patience and snaps at Monty.
            Both Monty and
            Quinn are taken aback. It’s then that Quinn realizes what’s happening to him.</li>
          <li>On the third day, Quinn knows he has the red plague and is about to die. Meanwhile, Monty is oblivious to
            his dad’s
            symptoms, focused only on the goal of getting to Paradise Valley and becoming Cool™. Quinn, not wanting
            Monty to have to
            witness what’s about to happen to him, stops and tells Monty that he should go on without him.</li>
          <li>Quinn knows he’ll never see Monty again, but Monty is still oblivious. Excited to finally be on his own
            and away from
            his parents, he only gives a quick goodbye before dashing off.</li>
          <li>(Quinn watches him go and waits until long after he can’t see him anymore).</li>
          <li>Monty relishes his alone time (though nights alone scare him a bit). It only takes a couple more days

            trials and prove
            himself.</li>
